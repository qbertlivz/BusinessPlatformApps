# Introduction
Create a scalable, secure and flexible PowerBI dashboard on Salesforce with the Power BI Sales Management solution template for Salesforce. The template creates everything required for an end-to-end analytics solution on your Salesforce org including the data extraction, database constructs, and a Power BI report bound to the database. You can extend or customize the result to accommodate your own business requirements.
The Sales Management solution template for Salesforce is intended for customers who:
-	Want to provision an analytics solution for tens or even thousands of users
-	Want to deploy an analytics solution that scales with any size of Salesforce instance from small to very large
-	Want to be able to create data mashups on Salesforce with data from their ERP, marketing, inventory management or other any other application
The Sales Management solution template for Salesforce is targeted at sales executives, managers and sales professionals to forecast revenue, compare sales to the same period in the prior month, quarter or year, track sales against goals and monitor their pipeline .
This document describes how to provision the Sales Management solution template for Salesforce, the architecture, and how to extend or customize the template. The audience for this document is intended to be the IT professional or administrator who implements and manages the solution template and/or the developer who extends or customizes the solution template.
Please contact <PBISolnTemplates@microsoft.com> for any questions or issues with this document.

# Architecture
There are two architectures supporting the solution template:
-   Azure
-	On-premise

For Azure installations, all that is required is an Azure subscription (athough an existing Azure SQL DB can be used if available.)
This has all the advantages of Software as a Service where you pay as you go. All the patching and upkeep is handled for you. You can also later publish your reports to PowerBi.com.

The on-premise option encompasses on-premises SQL Server and SQL Server running on an Azure virtual machine. You are responsible for providing the hardware and SQL Server to host the extracted Sales for Dynamics 365 data. 
as well as all patching and upkeep. Publishing reports to PowerBI.com will require a separate installation of a gateway.

In both architectures, new and changed records are pulled from Dynamics 365 to populate a destination database (how data is pulled and SQL database are described in later sections) after which the approach differs.

For Azure installations, there are two options for how Power BI accesses the Sales for Dynamics 365 data:
-	Import data into Power BI
-	Live connection from Azure Analysis Services (not available for on-premise deployments)

The Import data into Power BI option (henceforth termed the import option) is where the data is pulled out of the SQL database to populate the model in Power BI. On every refresh, all the data is pulled out of the SQL database to refresh the Power BI model. When the model is published to Power BI, the data will be resident in the Power BI service:


![ImportDataOption](Resources/Images/ImportDataOption.png)

The Live Connection from Azure Analysis Services (henceforth termed the AAS option) is where the data is pulled from the SQL database to populate an Analysis Services tabular model. The Power BI reports are bound to the Analysis Services tabular model instead of directly to the SQL Database. 

![SSASOption](Resources/Images/SSASOption.png)

When the model is published to Power BI, the data stays in Analysis Services and does not move with it to the Power BI service. Viewing published reports results in queries sent to Analysis Services from the Power BI service:
The Import option is recommended when:
-	The amount of data in Power BI is less than the 1 GB limit (remember, this is a compressed size representing a data volume roughly 10x this size, or 10GB of Dynamics 365 data.

The AS option is recommended when:
-	The amount of data in Power BI is greater than 1 GB or might be greater than 1 GB in the future.
-   You need the extra performance available with Azure Analysis Services service tiers
-	You want the data available for reporting with other tools in addition to Power BI that can take advantage of Analysis Service’s capabilities.

# System Requirements
Setting up the template requires the following:
-	Azure Subscription
-	Power BI Desktop (latest version)
-	Power BI Pro (to share the template with others)
-	A Salesforce account

# How to Install
Installing the Sales Management solution template for Salesforce configures the following:
-	Data extraction (Azure Data Factory, Informatica, or Scribe)
-	SQL Server database or Azure SQL Database (an existing Azure SQL DB can be used or a new instance can be created during provisioning)
-	Azure Analysis Services (optional)
-	Power BI report

The detailed description of each component of the architecture is below. To get started, navigate to the Power BI solution templates from the Solutions menu on powerbi.com:

![Solutions Menu](Resources/Images/SolutionsMenu.png)
From there, select the Sales Management for Salesforce solution template and click the "Install now" button.

There are two distinct flows for the installation:

**Azure installation**: This has all the advantages of Software as a Service where you pay as you go. All the patching and upkeep is handled for you. You can also later publish your reports to PowerBi.com without having to install a gateway (more on this later).

**On-premises installation**: This encompasses the option for on-premises SQL Server and SQL Server running on an Azure virtual machine. In the first case data will be moved to an instance of an on-premises SQL Server (i.e. SQL Server on hardware you own and that you maintain). The second option consists of SQL Server running on an Azure virtual machine. In this architecture, you are responsible for all patching and upkeep.

## Architecture Choices


_Note: Azure Data Factory is currently only supported for Azure SQL Database._

![Solutions Menu](Resources/Images/ArchChoices.png)

The on-premise architecture requires the configuration of an on-premises SQL Server or SQL Server on an Azure virtual machine and a windows installer is required for this change.
A "Download" button appears. Click this to download an installer for the solution template.

For Azure installation, continue to step 2a. For on-premise installation, jump to step 2b,



### Azure Installation Instructions

#### Step 1 Connect to Azure

Connect to Azure to grant the provisioning application th permissions to create resources in your subscription on your behalf.
![AzureConnect](Resources/Images/ConnectAzure.png)

Once authenticated, select the azure subscription where any resources will be created:
![AzureConnect2](Resources/Images/ConnectAzure2.png)

The advanced option allows the name of the resource group to be changed from its default value. 


#### Step 2 Connect to Salesforce
Provide your Salesforce credentials to gain access to Salesforce. The security token will have been sent to you when your credentials were first created and with each password change. If you do not know this token, connect directly to Salesforce and generate a new token.
The Salesforce login URL normally does not need to be changed from the default <https://login.salesforce.com>. Change this to <https://test.salesforce.com> if you are testing against a sandbox (a copy of your production environment used for testing and development).

![Connect to Salesforce](Resources/Images/ConnectSalesforce.png)

#### Step 3 Select how to Move Data
Decide how you want to move data. The options are :
- Azure Data Factory (default)
- Scribe 
- Informatica

![Connect to Salesforce](Resources/Images/MoveData.png)

If Scribe or Informatica are selected, your account information will be required.

#### Step 4 Configure Azure SQL DB Target

Connect to an existing SQL Server or provide details which the application will use to spin up an Azure SQL on your behalf. Only Azure SQL is supported for this template. If a user chooses to spin up a new Azure SQL, this will get deployed in their Azure subscription inside the newly created resource group.
![ConnectSQL](Resources/Images/ConnectAzureSQL.png)


Expand the advanced option to change the Azure SQL Database service tier or data center location.


_Important note_: If you use an existing Azure SQL DB, you **_must_** safelist your client IP address shown on this page in the Azure portal before you continue.
If you do not, you will not be able to read data from Azure SQL DB to populate the Power BI file. To safe-list the IP addresses, follow the instructions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-configure-firewall-settings/).

Click “Next” to continue.


#### Step 5 Azure Analysis Services Election

Choose whether Azure Analysis Services is to be used in the solution.c

![ChooseAAS](Resources/Images/AzureASOption.png)


#### Step 6 Configure Azure Analysis Services (optional)
If Azure Analysis Services was chosen, create a new instance of Analysis Services or use an existing one.

![ConnectAAS](Resources/Images/AzureASConnect.png)

For new instances, select the Azure Analysis Services service tier. Learn more about Azure Analysis Services service
 tiers [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/analysis-services/)

 The credentials provided are used as the system administrator for the Azure Analysis Services instance. When connecting to this instance, these credentials must be used (unless other users have been provided access separately).


#### Step 6 Tailor your Sales Management solution template for Salesforce
Provide the starting month of your fiscal calendar. This is required for fiscal year calculations in the Power BI file.

![Customize](Resources/Images/Customize.png)

The refresh option is not provided for Azure Data factory was selected as changes replicated in real-time with this option.

When Azure Data factory is selected as the ETL provider, an additional field will be made available for emails. This is optional, and configures an alert system to notify the user if slices have failed.


## Step 9a: Track Progress
The next several steps actually provision the soluution template. 
![Track Prog](Resources/Images/TrackProgress.png)


Once data starts moving, a Power BI file can be downloaded that is bound to the Azure SQL database or Analysus Services instance specified earlier.  The Power BI report file (or pbix file) is pre-bound to the data destination (either Azure SQL Server or Azure Analysis Services). Follow the instructions on the first page in the report to show your data.

### On-premise Installation Instructions


## Step 2: Connect to ETL Account

All ETL providers require an agent to be installed to move data from Salesforce to the on-premises SQL Server or to SQL Server on an Azure VM. The agent can be installed on any machine with access to the destination but it is recommended to install the agent on the same machine.

**Informatica Instructions**
New Informatica users installing the solution template on a machine without the Informatica Cloud Secure Agent installed and registered to their account must first create an Informatica account and then install the Informatica Cloud Secure Agent on a machine that has access to destination SQL Server database.
![Connect to Informatica](Resources/Images/ConnectInformatica.png)
Once the account is created, download and install the Informatica Cloud Secure Agent from [here](https://app.informaticaondemand.com/ma/).  Register the Informatica Cloud Secure Agent with your Informatica credentials.
After the Informatica Cloud Secure Agent is installed, change the "New User" selection to "Existing User" and click "Validate". The Informatica Cloud Secure Agent will appear.

![Connect to Informatica Existing Account](Resources/Images/ExistingInfaAccount.png)

_Note: The list of agents are those registered with this account - not those installed on the machine._

If the Agent does not appear, validate the installation.

Click "Next" to continue.

**Scribe Instructions**
New Scribe users must first create an account and install the Scribe Online Agent. Instructions for downloading and installing the Scribe Online Agent can be found [here](http://help.scribesoft.com/scribeonline/en/sol/agent/agentinstall.htm). Once the account is created, install the Scribe Online Agent.
![Connect to Scribe](Resources/Images/ConnectScribe.png)
_Note: the list of Scribe Online agents are those registered with this account " not those installed on the machine._

Once the ETL account is created and agent is installed, change the selection "New User" selection to "Existing User", provide your credentials and click the Validate button.

![Connect to Informatica Existing Account](Resources/Images/ExistingScribeAccount.png)

The Organization drop down will contain at least one item created by the solution template (for existing Scribe users, this will contain all Scribe organization with replication enabled).

The Installed agent should appear in the agent dropdown. If it does not, verify your installation of the Scribe online agent.

Click "Next" to continue.

## Step 3: Connect to Salesforce
Provide your Salesforce credentials to gain access to Salesforce. The security token will have been sent to you when your credentials were first created and with each password change. If you do not know this token, connect directly to Salesforce and generate a new token.
The Salesforce login URL normally does not need to be changed from the default <https://login.salesforce.com>. Change this to <https://test.salesforce.com> if you are testing against a sandbox (a copy of your production environment used for testing and development).

![Connect to Salesforce](Resources/Images/ConnectSalesforce.png)

 Validate your credentials and click "Next".

### Step 4: Connect to SQL Server Database
Provide your Azure SQL Database credentials to gain access to the destination SQL Server database. Click validate check your credentials.

If SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) is used, enter an existing SSAS server name and the name of a new Analysis Services database. This SSAS database will be created on your behalf.

![Connect to SQL And SSAS](Resources/Images/ConnectSQLandSSAS.png)

## Step 5: Tailor your Sales Management solution template for Salesforce
Provide the starting month of your fiscal calendar. This is required for fiscal year calculations in the Power BI file.

![Customize](Resources/Images/Customize.png)

Define how often the data is refreshed from Salesforce. Note that the initial extraction can take some time - even up to a day. Once that is complete, subsequent extractions pull new and changed records only and complete very quickly.

Hyperlinks are created for each opportunity, lead and account to enable linking from Power BI reports directly into the related Salesforce object; e.g.
<https://na30.salesforce.com>.

Click "Next" to continue.

## Step 6: Validate the information provided
Scrutinize the information provided for errors. If everything is correct, click "Download & Run" to create the solution template.

![Ver](Resources/Images/Verify.png)

## Step 7: Track your progress
This page tracks your progress. Once the data starts to move, this page can be closed and the data will continue to be copied.
Click the "Download PBIX" button to download a Power BI file, SalesManagementReport.pbix, that is bound to the chosen SQL Azure database.

![TrackProgress](Resources/Images/TrackProgress.png)

## Step 8: Open the Power BI file
### Step 8a: Power BI Import from Azure SQL or SQL Server Database
If the data was imported directly into Power BI, proceed; otherwise skip to step 8b.
Open the downloaded Power BI file and take the following steps:
a)	Click "Apply Changes"
![Apply Changes](Resources/Images/ApplyChanges.png)
b)	Windows Credentials
On the windows tab, select "Use my current credentials":
![Use my current credentials](Resources/Images/WindowsCredentials.png)
c)	Database Credentials
Click the Database item in the left-hand pane and enter the username and password you provided for the Azure SQL database:
![Database Credentials](Resources/Images/DatabaseCredentials.png)
Click "Save".

### Step 8b: Power BI Live Connection to Analysis Services
_If the Power BI file is connected to SQL Server Analysis Service, proceed; otherwise follow the instructions in step 8a._

Open the Power BI file. ON the Home menu tab, select Edit Queries, then Data Source Settings:
![SSASDB](Resources/Images/SSASServerDatabase.png)
Enter the Server and Database name entered in the previous step and click OK. The Navigator dialog will appear:
![SSASNav](Resources/Images/SSASNavigator.png)
Click OK to view the report.
## Step 9: View the Report
At this point Power BI Desktop will connect and retrieve the data. Note that it may take some time for the initial data pull to finish.  

## Common Provisioning Questions
**I closed the "Track your Progress" page. How do I know when the data has been pulled out of Salesforce?**
You can connect to the ETL provider to track progress. For Informatica, connect to https://app.informaticaondemand.com/ma/  and use the credentials you provided in the Connect to ETL Account step. For Scribe, connect to <https://online.scribesoft.com/ScribeOnline.aspx#/Logon>.

For ADF, the status of the slices can be viewed through the Azure Portal- through the Data Factory Monitor and Manage view.

**I didn't download the Power BI file (the pbix file) but closed the "Track your Progress" page where it is downloaded from. Now what?**
Whoops. You'll have to repeat the provisioning process.

**I want to change how often data is extracted from Salesforce. How do I do that?**
Connect to your ETL provider:
- Informatica: <https://app.informaticaondemand.com/ma/>
- Scribe: <https://online.scribesoft.com/ScribeOnline.aspx#/Logon>.

Edit the replication task and change the schedule. Instructions for your ETL provider are beyond the scope of this document, but this is a simple matter of altering a schedule.

# Technical Description
This section describes each component of the solution template in detail.

## Azure Data Factory
When Azure Data Factory is selected as the extraction and load option, a number of resources are provisioned in the selected subscription:

-   Linked Services
-   Input and Output Datasets
-   Historical and Incremental pipelines
-  Alert to notify on failed slices (Optional)

### Linked services
There are 2 linked services created during the deployment.

|Linked Service | Description |
|-----          | ------------|
|Salesforce | The Salesforce linked service creates a connection to the Salesforce instance using a username, password and token. This requiers that the "Web API" permission set is enabled for that user in the Salesforce instance. [Enable API Access in Salesforce](https://www.data2crm.com/migration/faqs/enable-api-access-salesforce-permission-set/) |
|Azure SQL| The Azure SQL linked service created a connection to the database specified or created during configuration.|

### Input and Output Datasets
For each object that is being extracted out of Salesforce we create 2 datasets per type of pipeline (Historical and Incremental), totalling 4 datasets per object.

Once deployed, the datasets adhere to the following naming convention:
-   Historical - PreDeployment\_[TableName]\_[Input|Output]
-   Incremental - PostDeployment\_[TableName]\_[Input|Output]

The format for each dataset is determined at deployment time by querying the table metadata in Salesforce.

### Historical and Incremental Pipelines
For each object that is being extracted out of Salesforce we create 2 pipelines - Historical an Incremental.

The pipeline configuration will vary on the edition of Salesforce that the template is deployed against.

For Salesforce editions with a Concurrent API Request limit of 5, the configuration will include a mix of [OneTime and Scheduled pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/data-factory-create-pipelines/). Both OneTime and Scheduled pipelines will be chained together, ensuring the concurrency limit of 5 is not breached. All incremental pipelines are deployed as Scheduled and chained together.

For Salesforce editions with a maximum Concurrent API Request limit (25) the pipelines are deployed with no dependency between them and run in parallel.

If "None" was selected as the frequency for incremental pulls, the incremental pipelines will be deployed but in a "Paused" state.

### Copy Activity
Each pipeline is underpinned by a Copy Activity that queries the source (Salesforce) and calls a stored procedure in Azure SQL to store the data.

The query that gets executed is dynamically created for each object based on the metadata extracted from Salesforce. Each query is parametrized using the WindowStart and WindowEnd values. These represent the start and end times of a given activity slice.

~~~
$$Text.Format('SELECT Id, OpportunityId, SortOrder, PricebookEntryId, Product2Id, ProductCode, Name, Quantity, TotalPrice, UnitPrice,
ListPrice, ServiceDate, Description, CreatedDate, CreatedById, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedById, SystemModstamp, IsDeleted FROM
OpportunityLineItem WHERE (IsDeleted = FALSE OR IsDeleted = TRUE) AND ((CreatedDate > {0:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:sssZ} AND CreatedDate <=
{1:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:sssZ}) OR (LastModifiedDate > {0:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:sssZ} AND LastModifiedDate <= {1:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:sssZ}))',
WindowStart,WindowEnd)
~~~

Each activity has the same configuration, displayed below.

```json
"policy": {
                    "timeout": "02:00:00",
                    "concurrency": 1,
                    "executionPriorityOrder": "NewestFirst",
                    "style": "StartOfInterval",
                    "retry": 2,
                    "longRetry": 5,
                    "longRetryInterval": "01:00:00"
                }
```

In the case of Scheduled pipelines, the policies can easily be tailored to suit more specific needs. For OneTime pipelines, they need to be redeployed with a modified policy (the deployment template can be found under ResourceGroup deployments).

For a higher throughput for the historical load for example, the concurrency parameter can be set to a maximum of 8, meaning that for every object being loaded from Salesforce, there can be a maximum of 8 slices running at the same time.

## Customization
New pipelines and datasets can be added to the created data factory. The recommended way of adding such customizations is through the [copy wizard](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/data-factory-copy-data-wizard-tutorial/).

The necessary linked services, Salesforce and Azure SQL will already be created and available for use with new pipelines.

To ensure consistency in the data, a stored procedure should be used to insert data into SQL.

Before the pipeline is configured using the copy wizard, the target SQL table and stored procedure should be present in the database.


## Data Extraction and Load
The sales management solution template utilizes Informatica or Scribe replication jobs, or ADF pipelines to move the data. The following tables are replicated:
-	Account
-	User
-	Lead
-	Opportunity
-	OpportunityLineItem
-	OpportunityStage
-	Product2
-	UserRole

The tables are replicated with custom fields already included.
Additional entities can be replicated to the target database. Refer to Informatica or Scribe for instructions to add additional entities to the replication or modify the replication schedule.

## SQL Server DB - SQL Server or Azure SQL Database
### Tables
Tables replicated from Salesforce are replicated to the dbo schema. Other tables and any other objects are created in the schema smgt.

The following additional tables are added to the target database.

### UserAscendantsview
This view is used for row level security. It contains a row for every combination of individual another person one or more levels above in the reporting hierarchy as defined by the role the user has been assigned to. For example, consider when person A reports to person B who reports to person C. This table will contain:

<sub>

| User | Ascendant User |
|------|----------------|
| A | A |
| A | B |
| A | C |
| B | B |
| B | C |
| C | C |

</sub>

_Note: the reporting hierarchy is taken from a user's role assignments and not the user's  ManagerID as defined in the user table. If this behavior is required, edit the UserAscendantView definition._

Security is defined so that all ascendants of an user (as defined by which users are assigned to parent role based on the UserRole table) have read permissions to records to which that user is  the owner. If the security model is customized, this view can be modified or deleted.

<sub>

| Column         | Datatype           |  Source      | Description  |

## SQL Server Analysis Services
A SQL Server Analysis Services tabular model is an optional component of the Sales management solution template. The tabular model in SQL Server Management Studio is produced below:

![SSASModel](../Common/Resources/Images/SSASModel.png)

The Connection object contains a reference and credentials to the SQL database. This can be edited if the database is changed after the initial installation.
The table objects are identical to the objects in the Power BI model and are described there.
There are two roles defined, Hierarchical Security and SQL Server Agent Security. Hierarchical Security is a DAX expression that uses the reporting relationships from Salesforce to define row level security on the Opportunity, Account and Lead objects. By default, a user can see the object values that they own or their reports (drawn from Salesforce) own. Hierarchical security depends on a view created in the destination database that unwinds the reporting structure, UserAscendantsView. This view includes a row for each user and manager combination. For example, if John reports to Margaret who reports to JoAnne, this view contains the (logical) rows:

<sub>

|User | User Ascendant |
|-----|----------------|
| John | 	Margaret |
| John | JoAnne |
| Margaret |	JoAnne |

</sub>


This table is used by SSAS to compute row level security.  For example, the DAX expression below determines if  an account is owned by a user or if it is owned by an individual who reports to that individual:
~~~~
=or(
		contains(filter('User Ascendants','User Ascendants'[Ascendant Domain user]=username()), [User Id],  'Opportunity'[Owner Id]),
		contains(filter('User Ascendants','User Ascendants'[Ascendant Domain user]=username()), [User Id],  lookupvalue('Account'[Owner Id], [Account Id], 'Opportunity'[Account Id]))
	)

~~~~

The security DAX expressions can be changed in SQL Server Management Studio or in Visual Studio.


## SQL Server Agent
If the SQL Server Analysis Services option is chosen, a SQL Server agent job entitled "Data load and processing" is created to launch the data replication process and  process the tabular model:
![SQLAgent](../Common/Resources/Images/SQLAgent.png)


The SQL Server Agent Job has four steps:

![AQLAgentSteps](../Common/Resources/Images/SQLAgentSteps.png)

The "Start solution processing" step initiates the ETL. The "Check data load" step validates that the
load succeeded. "Update domain account information" determines each user's domain name based on their email addresses (refer to table usermapping). The process SSAS database performs a full process on all tables in the SSAS tabular model.

The above steps launch PowerShell scripts found in the installation folder.

# Report Walkthrough

The aim of this section is to walk through the Sales Management Solution Template.

Sales Managers manage anywhere between a few individual salespeople to many sales teams with multiple levels of hierarchy. Sales teams use CRM to input information about the open opportunities they are working on and use an ERP system to track actual sales (i.e. all of the opportunities the sales team(s) have closed). Performance is measured against quotas set against salespeople and/or products.

Sales Managers are interested in tracking overall performance and progress but also want to see how sales teams or even individual sales people are performing. When measuring progress, it is important to see all data  such as open revenue, closed revenue and quotas together in one place. This allows them to answer key questions like:
-	Which opportunities did I lose yesterday? Which of those was I expecting to win?
-	How much actual sales have I closed this month? How does this compare to the same time period last year or the year before?
-	How much pipeline coverage do I have for this quarter? How does this differ by sales team and product?
-	How much variance to quota do I have by sales team?
-	What does my win loss ratio look like for my worst performing product?

The next few pages go through a detailed walkthrough of each page of the Sales Management reports. They include a high-level aim of the page, a description as well as screenshots.

## Daily View
The purpose of the Daily report is for Sales Managers to view detailed information about important things that change on a daily basis.

The "Daily View" page is split into two key sections: "Retrospective" and "Looking Ahead".

![DailyView](../../../../SiteCommon/Resources/Images/PBI_SM_DailyView.png)

The "Retrospective" View is concerned about reporting on things that have already happened this quarter. There are two key tables to focus on " the revenue a team has brought in this quarter and the opportunities that have been lost this quarter. On the left hand side one can see the "Variance to Prior Day" metric. This provides a quick indicator of how sales have changed since yesterday.

"Looking Ahead" on the other hand, is concerned with the opportunities that remain open this quarter. It provides details on who owns a given opportunity, how much it's worth and when should it close. A key metric given on the left hand side is how much revenue is in the pipeline.

An important aim of the "Daily View" however, is to give a Sales Manager the finest level of granularity they may wish to view their data by. Whilst the default report page looks at things on a quarter level, a Sales Manager may be interested in seeing the opportunities that were lost this week or the opportunities that are expecting to close tomorrow. By using the time slicers present on the page, a Sales Manager can view their data at a month, week or day level. The slicers at the top of the page update the "Retrospective view (i.e. the past), whereas the slicers in the second half of the page update everything "Looking Ahead".

![DailyViewF](../../../../SiteCommon/Resources/Images/PBI_SM_DailyViewFiltered.png)

## Sales Performance
The purpose of the Sales Manager page is to use historical data to evaluate the current performance of one or more sales teams.

![SalesPerf](../../../../SiteCommon/Resources/Images/PBI_SM_SalesPerformance.png)


The Sales Performance view helps Sales Managers answer questions about how their teams are performing compared to previous years. The right-hand side of the page looks at Year to Date sales (i.e. all sales that have occurred between today and the beginning of the year). It then contrasts these sales with sales for the same time period but in previous years. In the screenshot one can thus see sales for the first 7 weeks of the year compared to the first 7 weeks in 2015 and 214. One can then also view important high level metrics around revenue made this year as well as growth compared to last year.

The middle graph shows the same information at a quarter view whereas the left-hand graph looks at month to date sales. In our example above, month-to-date and year-to-date sales are the same. This is because this is still in the first quarter of the year. The month-to-date view on the other hand, shows a different picture. Here we are looking at the first 11 days of February (our current month) and comparing them to the first 11 days of February in 2015 and 2014.

Finally, the slicers at the top of the page include all of the Sales Managers direct reports (salespeople or sales team managers). A Sales Manager is thus able to select a specific sales team and look at their sales performance compared to not only their previous year performances but also the global average for the Sales Manager's teams.


![SalesPerfF](../../../../SiteCommon/Resources/Images/PBI_SM_SalesPerformanceFiltered.png)

## Pipeline View
The purpose of the Pipeline view is to monitor the health of the sales pipeline

![Pipeline](../../../../SiteCommon/Resources/Images/PBI_SM_Pipeline.png)

This view focuses on the health of the sales pipeline. The main way pipeline health is evaluated is by measuring pipeline coverage (i.e. by summing up actual sales with all my open opportunities, does that compare to quota). Some sales mangers like to use percentages higher than 100% (e.g. 120%) to indicate a healthy pipeline as they assume not all opportunities will be closed. In our report, any pipeline coverage above 100% appears as green. On the report pipeline coverage is also split by sales team/salesperson and product to provide a more detailed understanding of pipeline.

In the sample report, one can see that while there is a very impressive pipeline coverage for Server Platform (nearly 500%), some of the other products have much lower pipeline coverage. As a Sales Manager, one could investigate why certain products are not generating as much interest and reprioritize the focus of the sales teams away from Server Platform to other areas. We have also enabled drilling down capabilities in the  owner and product pipeline coverage bar graphs. This means that clicking on a particular sales team will uncover all of the sales people that belong to the team, whereas clicking on a product family will uncover all the products associated with it. For example, "drilling" into Server Platform will allow one to see whether there is one product that has resulted in the huge surge of pipeline coverage for Server Platform, or whether all Server Platform products extremely popular. As one can see below, it appears to be the latter with all apart from one Server Platform product having very good pipeline coverage:


![PipelineCoverage](../../../../SiteCommon/Resources/Images/PBI_SM_PipelineCoverage.png)

Another metric that complements pipeline coverage is "Gap to Green". Gap to green looks at how much more revenue needed in the pipeline is required to reach quota. A negative gap to green (as shown above in green) indicates one has already surpassed the amount required. The other card metrics on the report look at the amount of opportunities that have a high, medium and low likelihood of closing.

The cumulative graph in the bottom right hand corner provides some insights on the Pipeline page. The green line shows cumulative actual sales for the chosen time period (dictated by the time slicers at the top of the page). In the example above, actual sales for FY16Q1 are shown. For actual sales, an upward trending line is expected which goes flat after the current day (as actual sales cannot be made in the future). The cumulative expected revenue line shows a sum of actual sales along with my expected revenue based on open opportunity close dates. This line should perfectly overlay actual sales line (as one cannot have open revenue estimated to close in the past). Finally, a cumulative quota that goes up in monthly increments is shown (here quotas are assumed to be set monthly). A very useful question this graph helps answer is "at which point in the month/quarter/year can one expect to pass one's quota". Product and owner bar graphs can be used to cross filter the cumulative graph to answer that question about specific people or products.

Finally, a slicer above the cumulative graph depicts the probability with which an opportunity will close. 10% indicates an low probability of closing whereas 100% indicates the opposite. A Sales Manager can thus start with 100% and continue incrementing downwards until they find out which opportunities need to close in order to reach their target. In the example below, opportunities that have 100% close probability for Azure are viewed:

# Azure Data Factory Pricing

Below is an estimated cost of Azure Data Factory based on the number of rows copied from Salesforce:

- 800k rows will cost approximately $0.25
- 1.5M rows will cost approximately $0.50
-	3M rows will cost approximately $1

In addition to the actual cost of number of rows moved, additional cost will be incurred as follows:

-	Each high frequency (Every 15/30 minutes, Hourly) activity in ADF will have a monthly charge of $1
-	Each low frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) activity in ADF will have a monthly charge of $0.6
-	The first 5 low-frequency activities in a month are free of charge
-	Each hour of actual data movement will cost $0.25

These are all estimated costs. For a more detailed breakdown of pricing you can refer to the [Azure Data Factory pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/?service=data-factory) and calculate a price based on your needs.
