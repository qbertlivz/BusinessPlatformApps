        <div class="st-terms-of-use">
            These terms of use are a contract between you and Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”). These terms apply to your access and use of the Power BI Solution Template Tool, including any Microsoft software, services, catalogues, data, sites, information, materials, content and updates made available to you as part of the Power BI Solution Template Tool (the “Tool”), except to the extent those come with their own respective terms. By using the Tool, you agree to these terms of use. If you do not agree, you may not use the Tool.
        </div>
        <div class="st-terms-title">1. Overview</div>
        <div class="st-terms-of-use">
            The Tool enables you to import data from services such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce.com into Microsoft Power BI. The Tool creates a copy of such data and does not remove the data from the source service.
            The Tool may require you to use third party services or software to facilitate the data transfer into Power BI (each such service or software, a “Third Party Service”). Your use of a Third Party Service is subject to any legal terms provided by the third party providing such service. Microsoft is not a party to any legal terms provided by such party and does not assess or guarantee their accuracy or completeness. No right or license to any intellectual property of Microsoft or any of its affiliates is granted with respect to any Third Party Service. You are responsible for identifying, understanding and complying with the relevant legal terms for any Third Party Service you use.

Microsoft also may choose not to release a Preview as a "General Availability" commercial release.
